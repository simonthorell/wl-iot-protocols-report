### Protocol Summaries

- **WiFi** emerges as the go-to choice for high-bandwidth applications requiring internet access, 
although at the cost of higher power consumption.
- **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** offer versatility, with BLE being particularly advantageous 
for battery-operated devices due to its low energy profile.
- **Zigbee** and **Z-Wave** stand out in creating extensive, low-power mesh networks, 
ideal for home automation and sensor networks.
- **NFC** offers a unique niche in close-proximity, secure transactions and data exchange.

### Conclusion: Choosing the Right Wireless Protocol for IoT
