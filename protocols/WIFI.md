## WIFI
### WiFi - Protocol Overview:


WiFi or Wireless Fidelity is a popular wireless communication protocol allowing devices to detect and communicate over a local area network (LAN) without the use of cables. The device works in two frequency bands, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, providing high data rates.


### Range
Usually, WiFi provides a powerful coverage, that is, within 30 meters indoors and 100 meters outdoors. It ensures its appropriateness in different applications, ranging from home networking to larger scale deployments.


### Power Consumption
With WiFi, one of the issues is its high power consumption against low power wireless protocols. This is a determining parameter for battery-powered IoT devices.


### Security
WiFi has many security means by which it secures the data during its transmission. Standard security protocols are WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), WPA (WiFi Protected Access), and the more advanced WPA2/WPA3. These protocols are encryption and authentication methods of the secure communication.


### Other Considerations for IoT:


This is best for the IoT applications that require high data speeds.
It allows more than one device to be connected at the same time, hence is appropriate for scenarios with several connected devices.
WiFi-enabled IoT devices can reuse the already existing infrastructure available in households and businesses, thus making deployment straightforward.
Conclusion:
WiFi is an all-around, very popular wireless protocol, which has a great range, and excellent data transfer rates. Its suitability to IoT applications relies on particular requirements, considering power consumptions and the requirement of fast data transfer. Also, the powerful security features of WiFi create it a secured destination for numerous IoT implementations.
